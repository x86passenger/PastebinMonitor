This script uses a file called dorklist.txt this can be set to whatever you like to perform automated searches.
This relies on googles custom search API and programmable search engine, prior attempts to immitate real traffic programmitaclly resulted in a swift ban.
Setting the dorklist to monitor pastebin in particular used the parameter inurl:pastebin intitle:*insert your desired data*
Without using the structured google dorks it's basically just a search script .
